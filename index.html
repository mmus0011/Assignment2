                <p style="font-size: 14;">  This Webpage helps to visualise two major industries in Australia, Mining and Retail trade industry. Mining belongs to the primary sector and Retail trade belongs to the Tertiary sector. We aim to visualise how these industries have performed over time and which industry is contributing more to the Australian economy. 
                    We would start with the Retail trade industry as we have more data available on that.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">The map above shows how much revenue (in millions) have been generated by the Retail trade industry in each state of Australia in the  
                last 20 years.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">This heat map shows how the retail trade industry has performed over the years. Years are shown on the horizontal axis (2001 to 2021) and months on a vertical axis. A clear trend can be seen as yeas passes by the                                                                                                                          revenue is increasing.

             <p style="text-align: justify;">It can be seen clearly that both industries have been doing great for the last 8 years as we see an upward trend for both industries. However, the Retail trade industry is generating more revenue than the mining industry.  </p>

             <p style="text-align: justify;">The bar Graph above compares each state and allows us to visualise which states are rich in minerals where mining takes place and which states are more inclined towards earning revenue through the retail trade industry. An interesting fact to be noticed here is that Western Australia is the only state which earns more revenue from mining than the retail trade industry.
